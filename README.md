Simple web project that is made for e-channeling.

The aim of this project was to produce an information system that will provide a means of scheduling appointments with doctors at the Federal Teaching Hospital remotely, resulting in the reduction of waiting time at the hospital.The implemenmtation results of the system proved that the system could allow patients book doctor appointments with the hospital, allow doctor view bookings after every appointment and reschedule apointment with patients if required.
